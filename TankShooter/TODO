TODO.....have model send state information accorss network?

get and set state strings?   sounds gooooooooooooood.  



Easily getting swampped by the traffic.  So, we will create one message string.

Who reads the message string? The model does.  So, we will re-write the
model code to read a message string.

A message handler has add message methods and a thread that sleeps, then 
transmits.   It has a socket for commands, and an array of strings.  Should 
have max size.




fish guts is good.
but, I think in regular mode, my tanks don't start in diff places


------ in network -------

1) seems like a disconnect, at the start, not in the same place
2) not in the same place when move or die
3) remote player doesn't seem to move well
5) bullets don't die

-------------
print host messages, and client recpts....

seems like not getting messages....new thread for host to listen.
reduced for client. 

could be getting spammed by threads?   Put a delay in sendig..worked better...
still some skips.....what about delay in clients.....need to package our messages......
